" Documentation: 
"   The purpose of this plugin is very simple, it can toggle words among
"   'true'=>'false', 'True'=>'False', 'if'=>'elseif'=>'else'=>'endif' etc . 
"
"   To use it, move the cursor on some words like 'true', 'False', 'YES', etc, 
"   call command 
"     :ToggleWord
"
"   It will toggle 'true'=>'false', 'False'=>'True', 'YES'=>'NO' etc. Yes,
"   this script will try to take the case into account when toggling words, so
"   'True' will be toggled to 'False' instead of 'false'. Currently the way to
"   check the case is very simple, but it works well for me.
"
"   You can define a map for 'ToggleWord' comand to make it easier: 
"     nmap ,t :ToggleWord<CR>
"
"   This script can search the candicate words to toggle based on
"   current filetype, for example, you can put the following configuration
"   into your .vimrc to define some words for python:
"      let g:toggle_words_dict = {'python': [['if', 'elif', 'else']]}
"   
"   There are some default words for toggling predefined in the
"   script(g:_toogle_words_dict) that will work for all filetypes.
"   Any comment, suggestion, bug report are welcomed.
